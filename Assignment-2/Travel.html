  The Uparkot is one of the most interesting of old forts. The parapets on the east, where the place is commanded by higher ground, 
  have been raised at least three times to give cover against the increasingly long range of projectiles. This fort has lots of things 
  to watch like Adi Kadi Vav, Cannons, Wedding pavilion, Grain House and more. You will love this place if you love ancient things and 
  want to explore more.

    Built in a beautiful old palace of Junagarh, the Darbar Hall Museum is amongst the finest museums in Gujarat as it preserves the treasures of the Junagarh rulers.
    Darbar Hall was the court for the erstwhile Nawabs of Junagadh and was later converted into a museum to preserve the possessions of Junagarh Maharajas.
    The artefacts like weapons, armour, palanquins, sparkling chandeliers, howdahs, diamond woven carpets, photos, gowns, silver items, jewellery and paintings that depict the lifestyles of the Nawabs are the major highlights of the museum.
